# go-traceurl
A Go implementation of a URL tracer.

------

ðŸš¨ I've only been using Go since late May 2023. ðŸš¨

[wheregoes.com](https://wheregoes.com) remains a fine site that you should probably use instead.  

I'm just doing this to learn Go.

## Usage Notes
There are some env variables that can be set:

- SERVE: set to 'tcp' to serve on PORT (see below), or 'socket' to serve on /tmp/go-trace.sock
- PORT: The port for the tcp server to listen on. Defaults to 8080
- MODE: [Currently in development]
